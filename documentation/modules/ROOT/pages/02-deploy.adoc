= Install Red Hat Cluster Advanced Management Operator

Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) is installed through Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), which manages the installation, upgrade, and removal of the components.

The OpenShift Container Platform provided in this lab meets the minimal https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.6/html/install/installing#requirements-and-recommendations[requirements] from the official documentation. The cluster hub components will be installed on worker nodes, no https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.6/html/install/installing#installing-on-infra-node[infrastructure] nodes will be provided.

NOTE: OpenShift Container Platform required access: Cluster administrator (cluster-admin) permissions.

== Installing from the OperatorHub web console interface

[#install]
== Installing from the OpenShift Container Platform CLI

The Openshift cluster provided in this lab has not RHACM operator installed, so the first step is proceed with the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management installation from the CLI.

* Before install run the installation, take a few seconds to review `install/01_acm-operator.yaml` YAML file which defines the following resources that will install the RHACM Operator:
** `open-cluster-management` namespace
** `open-cluster-management-rhte2023` OperatorGroup

[#setup]
= Setup a MulticlusterHub

Once the RHACM Operator is completed, proceed with the next step to create RHACM cluster hub, and verify the installation is succesfully, checking the hub cluster and all pods in namespace `open-cluster-management` are both in `Running` status:

* Before create RHACM cluster, take a few seconds to review this YAML file `install/02_acm-multicluster.yaml` which defines the following resources:
** `MultiClusterHub` RHACM Custom Resource

watch oc get pod -n open-cluster-management

NOTE: schedule pods on the master node is not recommended for Production.

If the cluster hub is in `installing` status indefinitely, check the operator logs or pods status as follows:

Once the RHACM cluster hub installation is completed, proceed getting the route where you will find your ACM Console's:

oc get routes -n open-cluster-management

Multicluster Hub has to be installed and the RHACM Console accesible to proceed with the next steps.

[#gitops]
= Integrate GitOps Operator

RHACM introduces a new `gitopscluster` resource kind, which connects to a `placement` resource to determine which clusters to import into Argo CD. This integration allows you to expand your fleet, while having Argo CD automatically engage in working with your new clusters. This means if you leverage Argo CD `ApplicationSets``, your application payloads are automatically applied to your new clusters as they are registered by RHACM in your Argo CD instances.

In order to integrate the Red Hat GitOps operator and the Advance Cluster Management cluster hub already deployed, run the following commands:

* Before proceed with the steps to integrate the GitOps Operator with RHACM, take a few seconds to review this YAML file `03_acm-gitops.yaml` which defines the following resources:
** `openshift-gitops` namespace
** `openshift-gitops-opertator` subscription
** `gitops-clusters` ManagedClusterSet
** `gitops-clusters` ManagedClusterSetBinding
** `gitops-clusters` Placement
** `argo-acm-importer` GitOpsCluster and
** `cluster` GitopsService
