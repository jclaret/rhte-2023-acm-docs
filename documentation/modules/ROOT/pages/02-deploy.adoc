== Install Advanced Custer Management Operator

We will go through the Advanced Custer Management Operator installation following below steps:

- **Clone Git repository**. After it has been forked before, clone it and change directory to the `rhte2023` folder 

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
git clone https://github.com/<your_github_account>/rhte-2023-acm-apps
cd rhte-2023-acm-apps/rhte2023/
----

All directories in the `rhte2023` folder:

- **Kustomize as a configuration manager**

Most of the files used in this lab are based in https://kustomize.io/[Kustomize] which is a CLI configuration manager for Kubernetes objects with a `kustomization.yaml` file. It is integrated with `oc` and `kubectl` command line tools and allows you to customize raw, template-free YAML files for multiple purposes declaratively. Kustomize relies on the following configuration layering to enable reusability:

- **Base Layer**: This layer specifies the most common resources.

- **Overlays**: This layer specifies use-case specific resources by utilizing patches to override other kustomization files and/or Kubernetes manifests.

Take a look and see how it works with this example. It does not apply any configuration, just render the YAMS files provided based on the `kustomization.yaml` configuration:

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc --context acm kustomize 02_bootstrap/base/acm_operator/base
----

- **Enable master node scheduling**

Let's start getting our hands dirty. We are going to enable master nodes for scheduling workloads to take advantage of all limited resources that we have in this lab.

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc --context acm replace -k 02_bootstrap/base/openshift/base
----

Let's check the results as follows:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc --context acm get scheduler cluster -o yaml -o=jsonpath='{.spec.mastersSchedulable}{"\n"}'
----

We are expecting "true" value.

image::deploy/deploy05.png[]

WARNING: This configuration is not recommended for production.

TIP: https://access.redhat.com/articles/2988581[OpenShift Admins Guide to jsonpath]

- **Install Advanced Custer Management Operator**:

Let's install the Advanced Cluster Management Operator running the following command which will create the following resources:

* `Namespace` - open-cluster-management
* `OperatorGroup` - open-cluster-management-rhte2023
* `Subscription` - Advanced Cluster Management Operator

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc --context acm apply -k 02_bootstrap/base/acm_operator/base
----

Let's check the results as follows:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
watch oc --context acm get pod -n open-cluster-management
----

Wait until all pods are in `Running` status as below:

image::deploy/deploy06.png[]

After installing the Advanced Cluster Management Operator, we also need to create the CRD object `MultiClusterHub`. 

- **Create `MultiClusterHub`**:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc --context acm apply -k 02_bootstrap/base/acm_multiclusterhub/base
----

image::deploy/deploy07.png[]

Let's check the results as follows:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,shell, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
watch oc --context acm get mch -o=jsonpath='{.items[0].status.phase}' -n open-cluster-management
----

Wait until the Advanced Cluster Management Operatator is installed. It can take up to 10 minutes.

image::deploy/deploy08.png[]

If the multiclusterhub is not in `Running` status after a while, check the operator logs or pods status as follows:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc --context acm logs multiclusterhub-operator-xxx-xxx -n open-cluster-management
----

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
watch oc --context acm get pod -n open-cluster-management
----

[#console]
== Access to the Advanced Cluster Management Web Console

Advanced Cluster Management Console is integrated with the Openshift Console, so once the ACM Operator is installed, the Openshift Console will show a new item "All Clusters" on the side navigation menu as below:

image::deploy/deploy00.png[]

**All Cluster** will provide access to the Advanced Cluster Management Console and "local-cluster" will provide access to the Openshift Cluster.

Also, the ACM provides a dashboard UI. We can access it through a OpenShift `Route`. List routes in the `open-cluster-management` namespace and get the address of console https://multicloud-console.apps.<YOUR_DOMAIN>. But, It will be deprecated in ACM 2.7

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc --context acm get route -n open-cluster-management
----

image::deploy/deploy09.png[]

Let's switch to the Advanced Cluster Management Console and Login with Openshift to check that it is working properly.

[#gitops]
== Install GitOps Operator

The next step is the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/cicd/gitops/installing-openshift-gitops.html[OpenShift GitOps Operator] installation. OpenShift GitOps uses https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/[Argo CD] to manage specific cluster-scoped resources. Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.

Let's install it:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc --context acm apply -k 02_bootstrap/base/gitops_operator/base/
----

image::deploy/deploy10.png[]

Let's check the results as follows:

- Pods in `openshift-gitops` namespace in `Running` status

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
watch oc --context acm get pods -n openshift-gitops
----

image::deploy/deploy12.png[]

- ArgoCD dashboard UI is accessible from the Openshift Console

image::deploy/deploy13.png[]

image::deploy/deploy14.png[]

Also, an Openshift `Route` is created:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc --context acm get route -n openshift-gitops
----

- Login into the ArgoCD Console with the Openshift credentials.

[#gitopsacm]
== Integrate Openshift GitOps and Advanced Cluster Management

Once we have completed the Advanced Cluster Management and Openshift Gitops Operators installation, we will go through the integration process between them. So, this process will let us:

- Deploy and discover ArgoCD multicluster applications
- Setup Git or Helm Applications based repositories
- Configure sync policies for our applications
- Configure placement based on labels or clustersets

Advanced Cluster Management introduces a new `gitopscluster` resource kind, which connects to a `placement` resource to determine which clusters to import into Argo CD. This integration allows you to expand your fleet, while having Argo CD automatically engage in working with your new clusters. This means if you leverage Argo CD `ApplicationSets`, your application payloads are automatically applied to your new clusters as they are registered by Advanced Cluster Management in your Argo CD instances.

image::deploy/deploy18.png[]

Let's run the following commands to perform the Openshift GitOps Operator integration with Advanced Cluster Management

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc --context acm apply -k 02_bootstrap/base/gitops_acm/base/
----

image::deploy/deploy11.png[]

It will create:

* a `ManagedClusterSet` - **rhte2023-gitops-clusters-vendor**. `ManagedClusterSet` resources allow the grouping of cluster resources. We will add both Openshift Cluster `local-cluster` and `rhte2023-cluster01` into this `ManagedClusterSet` which enables deployment across all of the Openshift Cluster.

* a `ManagedClusterSetBinding` - **rhte2023-gitops-clusters-vendor**. `ManagedClusterSetBinding` resource will bind a `ManagedClusterSet` **rhte2023-gitops-clusters-vendor** to a `namespace` **openshift-gitops**. It means that applications and policies that are created in the `openshift-gitops` namespace can only access managed clusters that are included in the bound managed cluster set resource.

* a `Placement` - **rhte2023-gitops-clusters-placement-vendor** based on a ManagedCluster label **vendor=Openshift** and claim **platform=AWS**

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,yaml, subs="+macros,+attributes"]

apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Placement
metadata:
  name: rhte2023-gitops-clusters-placement-vendor
  namespace: openshift-gitops
spec:

          matchExpressions:
            - key: platform.open-cluster-management.io
              operator: In
              values:
                - AWS
----

We will see more `Placements` examples on the next sections.

TIP: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.6/html-single/multicluster_engine/index#placement-binding[Placement Examples] to select a cluster wih the largest allocatable memory and/or CPU.

NOTE: When you integrate ACM with the GitOps operator for every managed cluster that is bound to the GitOps namespace through the placement and ManagedClusterSetBinding custom resources, a secret with a token to access the ManagedCluster is created in the namespace. This is required for the GitOps controller to sync resources to the managed cluster. When a user is given administrator access to a GitOps namespace to perform application lifecycle operations, the user also gains access to this secret and admin level to the managed cluster

[#managedcluster]
== Registering local-cluster to GitOps

After the ACM/GitOps integration is done, let's add `local-cluster` to `ClusterSet` **rhte2023-gitops-clusters-vendor**. This configuration will let us deploy applications matching Clusters **vendor=Openshift** and **platform=AWS**.

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc --context acm label ManagedCluster local-cluster cluster.open-cluster-management.io/clusterset=rhte2023-gitops-clusters-vendor --overwrite
----

and check that cluster `local-cluster` is added as an ArgoCD Cluster from the **ArgoCD Console > Settings > Clusters** where we expect to see `local-cluster` as one of the clusters

image::deploy/deploy16.png[]

image::deploy/deploy17.png[]

and the `local-cluster` belongs to `ClusterSet rhte2023-gitops-clusters-vendor` through `Openshift Console > Advanced Cluster Management > Clusters > Cluster sets`
