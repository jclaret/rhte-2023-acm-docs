== Hands-on Lab Environment

This hands-on lab will be based on two OpenShift clusters. The first one has been already installed with `OpenShift 4.10 Workshop` provided by `RHPDS` (https://demo.redhat.com), and the second one will be installed from ACM following the steps in this lab. Both Openshift clusters will run on Amazon Web Sservices public cloud:

- Cluster `local-cluster`: It has been already installed. In this cluster you will install ACM/GitOps Operators and deploy applications.

- Cluster `rhte2023-cluster01`: You will install the second Openshift cluster and deploy applications.

[#occontext]
== Switching context between clusters

In order to easily switch between Openshift clusters in this lab, we will create a new context for the local-cluster. 

- Login into the local-cluster

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc login -u kubeadmin -p <password> --insecure-skip-tls-verify https://api.<your_cluster>:6443
----

- Rename the current context to `acm`

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc config rename-context $(oc config current-context) acm
----

- List `acm` context

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc config get-contexts acm

- Check the new oc context works properly
