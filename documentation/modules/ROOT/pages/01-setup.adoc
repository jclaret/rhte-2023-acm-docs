== Hands-on Lab Environment

This hands-on lab will be based on two OpenShift clusters. The first one has been already installed with `OpenShift 4.10 Workshop` provided by `RHPDS` (https://demo.redhat.com), and the second one will be installed from ACM following the steps in this lab. Both Openshift clusters will run on Amazon Web Sservices public cloud:

- Cluster `local-cluster`: It has been already installed. In this cluster you will install ACM/GitOps Operators and deploy applications.

- Cluster `rhte2023-cluster01`: You will install the second Openshift cluster and deploy applications.
