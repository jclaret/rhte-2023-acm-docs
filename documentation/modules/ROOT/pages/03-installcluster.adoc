= Deploy another Openshift cluster

To deploy multicluster applications, you will need another OpenShift cluster deployed.

In this LAB, Amazon Web Services (AWS) Public Cloud Provider is being used. You will need to add the AWS credentials into Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management, and deploy a second OpenShift cluster after adding the credentials.

Using Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management and having two OpenShift clusters installed, you will have all the necessary requirements to acomplish the tasks in this LAB.

[#credentials]
= Setup credentials

In order to create a new OpenShift cluster on AWS, you will need to set-up the AWS credentials into Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management first. This credentials will allow Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management to install the OpenShift cluster on AWS.

You can setup the AWS credentials using the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management web interface, or using the command line interface (CLI).

To setup the credentials, you will need the following information:

. Name of AWS credentials
. Namespace where the credentials will be saved
. AWS Access Key ID
. AWS Secret Key
. Base domain
. A Global Pull Secret. If you don't have one, you can get it from https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret
. A SSH private key. If you don't have one, you can generate it with the following command:

[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
ssh-keygen
----

[#credsgui]
== Setup credentials via web interface

To setup the AWS credentials using the web interface, you need to enter to the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management route first. You can find it in the open-cluster-management namespace.

After entering into Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management web interface, you need to access into the "Credentials" section.

To create the new credentials, you should click into "Add credential" button.

[#credscli]
== Setup credentials via CLI

To setup the AWS credentials using the CLI, you can use the following YAML example file to create one crentials.yaml file:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,yaml, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
type: Opaque
metadata:
  name: <1 - Name of AWS credentials>
  namespace: <2 - Namespace where the credentials will be saved>
  labels:
    cluster.open-cluster-management.io/type: aws
    cluster.open-cluster-management.io/credentials: ""
stringData:
  aws_access_key_id: <3 - AWS Access Key ID>
  aws_secret_access_key: <4 - AWS Secret Key>
  baseDomain: <5 - Base domain>
  pullSecret: >
    <6 Global pull secret>
  ssh-privatekey: |
    <7 - A SSH private key>
  ssh-publickey: >
    ssh-rsa
    <8 - A SSH public key>
  httpProxy: ""
  httpsProxy: ""
  noProxy: ""
  additionalTrustBundle: ""
----

After you have created the file, you can create it with the following command:
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc create -f cretentials.yaml
----
