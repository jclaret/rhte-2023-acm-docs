= Deploy another Openshift cluster

To deploy multicluster applications, you will need another OpenShift cluster deployed.

In this LAB, Amazon Web Services (AWS) Public Cloud Provider is being used. You will need to add the AWS credentials into ACM, and deploy a second OpenShift cluster after adding the credentials.

With ACM and two OpenShift clusters, you will have all the necessary requirements to acomplish the tasks in this LAB.
